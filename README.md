In this engaging project, I leveraged the power of:

1️ **MySQL**: Perfect for querying the database efficiently.

2️ **Power BI**: A go-to tool for visualizing data, making insights pop!

3️ **PowerPoint**: Ideal for crafting impactful presentations.

Key takeaways:

1️ I delved deep into SQL concepts like Subqueries, Joins, CTEs, and Window functions to extract valuable insights for a real-world business scenario.

2️ Power BI's versatility allowed me to create compelling visualizations, including line charts, donut charts, and dumbbell charts, making complex data relationships easy to grasp.

3️ Crafting an effective presentation in PowerPoint was made simpler with its diverse features, ensuring my insights were communicated clearly and convincingly.

Hope you get out something from this
