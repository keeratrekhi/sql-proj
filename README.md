In this engaging project, I leveraged the power of:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **MySQL**: Perfect for querying the database efficiently.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Power BI**: A go-to tool for visualizing data, making insights pop!

3Ô∏è‚É£ **PowerPoint**: Ideal for crafting impactful presentations.

Key takeaways:

1Ô∏è‚É£ I delved deep into SQL concepts like Subqueries, Joins, CTEs, and Window functions to extract valuable insights for a real-world business scenario.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI's versatility allowed me to create compelling visualizations, including line charts, donut charts, and dumbbell charts, making complex data relationships easy to grasp.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Crafting an effective presentation in PowerPoint was made simpler with its diverse features, ensuring my insights were communicated clearly and convincingly.
